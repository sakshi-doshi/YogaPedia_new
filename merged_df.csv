health benefits
1) organs: as the abdominal muscles and psoas muscles are put to work, the internal abdominal organs are hence stimulated. The digestive juices are secreted well giving room for good digestion, the pancreas, the liver and kidney are all massaged well thus improving the functioning of these organs. The pelvic muscles are stretched and toned giving room for improved reproductive system.

Bharadvajasana,"1) human anatomy
boosts the parasympathetic nervous system: in bharadvajasana, while the spine gets a gentle twist from the base, the sacrum, the flow of prana along the spine reduces the stress. This , boosting the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for ‘rest-and-digest’, activities that occur when the body is at rest, especially after eating etc.
2) strengthens the oblique muscles: while in the twist, the oblique muscles which are part of the abdomen wall need to be flexible to turn and twist the torso in bharadvajasana. Thus the strength and the flexibility of these muscles improve with repeated practice of seated spinal twist pose. The functions of these muscles play an important role as they assist in rotating the trunk, making the rib cage flexible, supporting the abdominal wall and helping in flexing the torso.
general benefits
3) deep stretch to the spine with the gentle twist: in bharadvajasana, the entire spine at various parts get a stretch with the twist. At the lumbar region, the thoracic region and the cervical region. Hence while practicing this pose, one needs to connect to these stretches to improve the flow of prana.
4) stretches the shoulders and the hips: along with the spine, the shoulders get a deep stretch. The hips too get a gentle stretch with flexing the lower back. The muscles around the hips and the shoulders stretch to improve the flexibility too.
5)therapeutic for cervical pain: in the seated spinal twist pose, while the shoulders take a deep stretch towards one side, the neck muscles at the upper part of the spine get a gentle massage with the stretch, thus helping in reducing any pain related to cervicalgia. Remember to go slow with the twist and stay longer for better results.
6)therapeutic for carpal tunnel syndrome: with the pressure at the wrists while placing them on the floor and while taking the other wrists from behind, the tissue that are connected between the forearm to the hand get expanded and contracted, thus creating the right energy and with this flexing, pain related to carpal tunnel can be reduced, if not cured."
Parighasana,"1) chest, diaphragm and breath: stiffness in the intercostal muscles can lead to one taking shorter and smaller breaths, as the lungs aren’t able to expand fully. As the intercostal muscles of the extended side are stretched, it helps the lungs expand to their full capacity when breathing. This allows one to draw in deeper breaths, even when not performing the asana.
2) alignment and posture: to get the best form gate pose, alignment plays an important role. Students should be told to avoid the hips from going into a flexion which will take the pelvis behind, putting more pressure to the lower back. To avoid this engage the pelvis and keep it square (push them forward). To first understand this alignment, students can be introduced to this pose with the support of the wall, by resting the balls of the foot on the wall. This helps engage the deeper muscles of the pelvis (and strengthen the glutes). This small adjustment in alignment allows the hips to open even further, and hence can be included in classes for people who spend a lot of time sitting (in office, or when travelling), and even for students in teen yoga
3) stimulations and organs: the lateral bend helps stimulate the internal organs with the stretching and contracting of the deeper muscles. On the left side reside the stomach, small intestine and pancreas, and on the right reside gallbladder, liver and large intestine. As one goes into the lateral stretch, one side of the abdomen is compressed, which reduces the blood circulation in the area. This creates a ‘squeeze and release’ motion on the organs, which increases their efficiency once the blood circulation resumes. The organs on the extended side receive a stretch, which helps stimulate the stagnancy in organs.
4)herapy and healing: parighasana helps increase the immunity of the body in various ways. Firstly, as the chest is able to expand more than before, it helps increase the functioning of the respiratory system. This helps reduce the frequency and intensity of allergies, over a period of time. Secondly, it stimulates the lymphatic system as one moves the arm overhead, as the armpit houses lymph nodes, which play an integral part in the body's immunity. 
5) chakra and balancing: a wonderful practice which is a gentle heart opener, thus stimulating the anahata chakra (heart chakra), while ensuring balance in the first two chakras (root and sacral). The side bend helps to increase the prana moving from the heart towards the third eye chakra, energizing the body. And at the time of releasing from the pose, there is downward flow of energy - apana vayu (removing the excess out) thus ensuring a balance in the energy - and ultimately balance in the first four chakras."
Bhekasana,"1) improves the functioning of the adrenal glands: in bhekasana or frog pose, the deep stretch and pressure at the upper abdomen, while balancing in the pose activates the adrenal glands, located above the kidney. These glands help govern sudden bursts of energy and heat, like the fight or flight response.
2) improves the functioning of the pancreas: the pancreas are just below the stomach and helps in the secretion of digestive enzymes into the small intestine. This secretes the hormone insulin, and the pressure and stretch at the lower abdomen in bhekasana (frog pose), helps in the proper secretion of this hormone.
3) proper functioning of the reproductive system: the deep stretch at the lower abdomen encourages the internal organs to function well and the reproductive organs too get activated, balancing the level of hormones within the human body.
4) tightens the quadriceps: the deep stretch at the quadriceps, the upper thighs, during the practice of frog pose (bhekasana), helps to not only open these muscles, but also helps to strengthen them and make them tight. These muscles play a great role for stronger looking legs which are beneficial for athletes."
Kurmasana,"1) blood circulation improves with the elongated spine: in kurmasana, while the body goes in a forward fold taking the chest, abdomen and the pelvis towards the floor, the spine is elongated in this posture improving the circulation of blood flow. The flow of prana through the spine to other parts of the body becomes smooth opening the blocks.
2) activates the abdominal organs improving digestion: with the massage around the entire abdominal area with the forward fold in kurmasana, the internal organs too get activated, thus improving digestion, reducing problems related to kidney, and any problems related to liver.
3) improves the flexibility of the spine: with the deep stretch and extension of the spine, the muscles around the upper back, the lower back, the neck and the head, contract, slowly improving the flexibility of the spine. With the elongation of the spine and the flow of prana in a smooth way, flexibility of the entire spine improves giving room for challenging poses.
4) reduces the stiffness around the lower back relieving back aches: in kurmasana, the flexibility of the back is very essential keeping in mind the flow of smooth breathing. With the muscles around the lower back activated, and when done carefully, the nerves related to the back aches get their share of massage and prana, thus reducing the pain related to lower back.
5) reduces symptoms related to sciatic nerve: while the lower back in tortoise pose, extends, the largest nerve the sciatic nerve, which begins at the lower back and runs all through the buttocks and down the lower limbs gets a gentle massage. This massage, gives a comfort to the nerve and helps to reduce pain related to sciatica.
6) cures insomnia: though kurmasana requires a lot of flexibility as this pose is considered difficult, yet if done with support and with guidance, it acts as a great way to relax the entire nerves and calms the mind inducing sleep. Hence can be used therapeutically to heal insomnia.
